    "Sure, I can provide you with a list of five common functions in the pandas library along with their execution examples. Make sure you have the pandas library installed before running the code. You can install it using the following command:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at five functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`read_csv()`**: This function is used to read data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example CSV file: data.csv\n",
    "# Name, Age, City\n",
    "# Alice, 25, New York\n",
    "# Bob, 30, San Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading CSV into a DataFrame\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`head()`**: This function is used to display the first n rows of a DataFrame. By default, it shows the first 5 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Displaying the first 3 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "print(df.head(3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`info()`**: This function provides a concise summary of a DataFrame, including the data types, non-null values, and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Displaying information about the DataFrame\n",
    "print(df.info())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`describe()`**: This function generates descriptive statistics of the DataFrame, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Displaying descriptive statistics of the DataFrame\n",
    "print(df.describe())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`groupby()`**: This function is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria and then apply a function to each group independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Grouping the DataFrame by the 'City' column and calculating the mean age in each city\n",
    "grouped_data = df.groupby('City')['Age'].mean()\n",
    "print(grouped_data)\n",
