    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class and an object are fundamental concepts used to model and structure code. They are the building blocks of OOP and are essential for organizing and encapsulating data and behavior in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class**:\n",
    "   - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "   - It acts as a user-defined data type, specifying what attributes (data members) and methods (functions) an object created from the class will possess.\n",
    "   - Classes are reusable, which means you can create multiple objects based on the same class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of a simple Python class:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "           self.make = make\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "           self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "       def start_engine(self):\n",
    "           print(f\"{self.make} {self.model}'s engine is now running.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "       def stop_engine(self):\n",
    "           print(f\"{self.make} {self.model}'s engine is now stopped.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `Car` class defines the blueprint for creating car objects. It has attributes (make, model, year) and methods (start_engine, stop_engine) that describe the behavior of car objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object**:\n",
    "   - An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class blueprint, representing a specific entity with its own data and behavior.\n",
    "   - Objects are created from a class using a process called instantiation. Each object has its own set of attributes and can call the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of creating and using objects from the `Car` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Creating car objects\n",
    "   car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2022)\n",
    "   car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Accessing object attributes\n",
    "   print(car1.make)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "   print(car2.model)  # Output: Civic\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Calling object methods\n",
    "   car1.start_engine()  # Output: Toyota Camry's engine is now running.\n",
    "   car2.stop_engine()   # Output: Honda Civic's engine is now stopped.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `car1` and `car2` are two distinct objects created from the `Car` class. They have their own sets of attribute values and can call the class's methods to perform specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, classes provide a blueprint for creating objects, and objects are instances of those classes with their own unique data and behavior. OOP allows you to model and structure your code in a way that promotes modularity, encapsulation, and code reusability."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class.\n",
    "   - It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and prevents unintended interference and misuse of data.\n",
    "   - Encapsulation helps in maintaining the integrity of data by controlling how it is accessed and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called a superclass or base class).\n",
    "   - It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes, enabling the creation of new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method or message in a way that is appropriate for their specific class.\n",
    "   - It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even if they are actually instances of derived classes, leading to flexibility and extensibility in code design.\n",
    "   - Polymorphism often involves method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to a specific problem domain.\n",
    "   - It involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.\n",
    "   - Abstraction allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, making it easier to manage and understand complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars collectively provide a framework for designing and organizing code in an object-oriented manner, facilitating code modularity, flexibility, and maintainability."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the `__init__()` function, also known as the constructor method, is used to initialize the attributes or properties of an object when it is created from a class. It is a special method that gets automatically called when an object is instantiated from a class. The primary purpose of the `__init__()` function is to set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the `__init__()` function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attribute Initialization**: It allows you to initialize the object's attributes with specific values when the object is created. This ensures that the object starts with the desired initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customization**: You can provide arguments to the `__init__()` function to customize the initial state of each object differently. This allows you to create multiple objects of the same class with distinct attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**: It supports the encapsulation principle of OOP by allowing you to control how attributes are set and ensuring that they are set up correctly during object creation.\n",

    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Name: {self.name}\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Age: {self.age}\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Grade: {self.grade}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating student objects and initializing their attributes\n",
    "student1 = Student(\"Alice\", 18, \"A\")\n",
    "student2 = Student(\"Bob\", 17, \"B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing object attributes and calling methods\n",
    "student1.display_info()\n",
    "student2.display_info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Student` class has an `__init__()` method that takes three arguments: `name`, `age`, and `grade`. When you create a `Student` object, like `student1` and `student2`, the `__init__()` method is automatically called, and it initializes the attributes `name`, `age`, and `grade` for each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `__init__()` function, you ensure that each `Student` object starts with the correct initial values, and you can create multiple student objects with different characteristics."

    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), `self` is a convention used in many programming languages, such as Python, to represent the instance of a class within the class's methods. It is a reference to the current object being operated upon. The use of `self` is essential for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Differentiating Instance Variables**: In a class, you have attributes (variables) that are specific to each instance (object) of that class. By using `self`, you can distinguish between instance variables and local variables or function parameters. This allows you to access and modify the object's attributes within its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing Object State**: `self` allows you to access and manipulate the state (data) of the object. When a method is called on an object, it often needs to work with the object's attributes, and `self` provides a way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Method Invocation**: When you call a method on an object, the object itself needs to be passed as the first argument to the method. In many programming languages, including Python, this is done implicitly by using `self`. It tells the method which object it should operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consistency and Clarity**: Using `self` is a convention that makes code more readable and consistent. It clearly indicates that you are working with instance variables and methods, making the code's purpose and structure more evident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example in Python to illustrate the use of `self`:\n",

    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # self.name is an instance variable\n",
    "        self.age = age    # self.age is an instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a Person object\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the greet method on the object\n",
    "person1.greet()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `self` is used to access and set the instance variables `name` and `age` within the `__init__()` method. Later, when the `greet()` method is called on `person1`, it uses `self` to access the `name` and `age` attributes to print a personalized greeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `self` is a reference to the current instance of a class, and it is crucial for accessing and manipulating the object's attributes and for maintaining the state and behavior of objects in an object-oriented program."

    "**Inheritance** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and is used to establish a relationship between classes where one class inherits attributes and methods from another class. Inheritance allows you to create a new class (the derived or subclass) that is based on an existing class (the base or superclass). The key idea is that the derived class inherits the properties and behaviors of the base class and can also have additional attributes and methods or override the inherited ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance in OOP, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from only one superclass.\n",
    "   - This is the simplest form of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, both `Dog` and `Cat` are subclasses of the `Animal` superclass, and they inherit the `speak()` method. However, they override the `speak()` method to provide their own implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - In multiple inheritance, a subclass can inherit from more than one superclass.\n",
    "   - This allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent1:\n",
    "       def method1(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Parent2:\n",
    "       def method2(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
    "       def method3(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `Child` class inherits from both `Parent1` and `Parent2`. It can access attributes and methods from both parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - In multilevel inheritance, there is a chain of inheritance where a subclass inherits from another subclass.\n",
    "   - This forms a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Grandparent:\n",
    "       def method1(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Parent(Grandparent):\n",
    "       def method2(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent):\n",
    "       def method3(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `Child` class inherits from `Parent`, which in turn inherits from `Grandparent`. This creates a multilevel hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Vehicle:\n",
    "       def move(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "       def drive(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Bike(Vehicle):\n",
    "       def ride(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, both `Car` and `Bike` inherit from the common superclass `Vehicle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some common types of inheritance in OOP. Each type has its own use cases and implications, and the choice of which type to use depends on the design and requirements of your program."
