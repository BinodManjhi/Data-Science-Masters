    "In Python, an exception is an event or condition that occurs during the execution of a program, leading to the disruption of the normal flow of the program. When an exceptional event occurs, Python raises an exception, which is an object that represents the error or problem that occurred. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as trying to access a file that doesn't exist, dividing by zero, or attempting to use a variable that hasn't been defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a Python program.\n",
    "   - They are raised when the interpreter encounters an operation that it cannot execute because it is invalid or impossible at that point in the program.\n",
    "   - Exceptions are typically caused by logical errors, external factors (e.g., user input, file availability), or unexpected conditions.\n",
    "   - Examples of exceptions include `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `TypeError`.\n",
    "   - You can handle exceptions using `try` and `except` blocks to gracefully handle error situations and prevent your program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the interpretation of the Python code before it is executed.\n",
    "   - These errors are caused by violations of the Python language's syntax rules. They are usually the result of typos, missing colons, incorrect indentation, or improper use of language elements.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all. They are detected by the Python interpreter when the code is parsed.\n",
    "   - Common examples of syntax errors include forgetting to close parentheses, misspelling keywords, or using operators incorrectly.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors must be fixed before you can run the program, and they are usually relatively easy to identify because Python provides error messages that point to the specific issue in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that occur when a program is executing and can be handled using exception handling techniques. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase and must be fixed before the program can run."

    "When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it results in the termination of the program's normal execution. The Python interpreter will print an error message to the console, and the program will come to an abrupt halt. This can be problematic, especially in production code or when you want your program to continue running even if an error occurs. Unhandled exceptions can lead to crashes and undesirable behavior in your software.\n",

    "\n",
    "result = divide(numerator, denominator)\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a function `divide` that takes two arguments and attempts to divide them. The `denominator` variable is set to 0. When we call `divide(10, 0)`, it will result in a `ZeroDivisionError` because dividing by zero is not allowed in Python. However, we haven't included any exception handling code to deal with this error.\n",

    "  File \"example.py\", line 6, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide(numerator, denominator)\n",

    "    result = a / b\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, a traceback is displayed, indicating the location in the code where the exception occurred. In this case, it shows that the `ZeroDivisionError` happened in the `divide` function at line 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper exception handling, the program terminates, and any subsequent code is not executed. This can be problematic, especially in larger applications, as it leaves your program in an unpredictable state and may disrupt the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle exceptions, you can use a `try` and `except` block to gracefully catch and manage exceptions, allowing your program to continue running and providing a better user experience. Here's how you can modify the previous example to handle the `ZeroDivisionError`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",

These statements allow you to enclose a block of code that might raise an exception within a `try` block, and then specify how to handle the exception in the `except` block. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the program will jump to the corresponding `except` block, and you can define how to manage the exception there.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Continue with other parts of the program\n",
