    "A generator function in Python is a special type of function that allows you to create an iterator, often used for generating a sequence of values lazily, one at a time. Generator functions use the `yield` keyword instead of `return` to yield a value from the function while maintaining its state, allowing it to resume execution from where it left off when the next value is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantages of using generator functions with `yield` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Memory Efficiency: Generator functions are memory-efficient because they generate values on-the-fly, without the need to store the entire sequence in memory. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lazy Evaluation: Values are produced as needed, which can improve performance and reduce initialization time for sequences that are not fully utilized.\n",

    "for num in gen:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `square_numbers` is a generator function that yields the square of numbers from 1 up to the specified `limit`. When you create a generator object `gen` and iterate through it, each time you iterate, the function's execution is paused at the `yield` statement, and the yielded value is returned. The function's state is retained, so it can continue from where it paused in the next iteration.\n",
