    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within a particular range of values. The PDF is often denoted by $f(x)$, where $x$ is the variable, and it satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability that $X$ takes any specific value is given by the area under the curve of the PDF at that point. In mathematical terms, this is expressed as:\n",

    "1. **Discrete Probability Distributions:**\n",
    "   - **Discrete Uniform Distribution:** Each outcome has an equal probability of occurring. Examples include rolling a fair die or choosing a card from a standard deck.\n",
    "   - **Bernoulli Distribution:** Models two possible outcomes (usually success or failure) with probabilities \\(p\\) and \\(1-p\\), where \\(p\\) is the probability of success.\n",
    "   - **Binomial Distribution:** Represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "   - **Poisson Distribution:** Models the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space, given the average rate of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous Probability Distributions:**\n",
    "   - **Continuous Uniform Distribution:** Describes a continuous random variable with equal probability of falling within a specified range.\n",
    "   - **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution:** Characterized by a bell-shaped curve. Many natural phenomena follow this distribution.\n",
    "   - **Exponential Distribution:** Models the time until an event occurs in a Poisson process.\n",
    "   - **Gamma Distribution:** Generalizes the exponential distribution to account for varying rates of occurrence.\n",
    "   - **Beta Distribution:** Represents the distribution of probabilities for a random variable limited to the interval [0, 1].\n",
    "   - **Cauchy Distribution:** Has heavy tails and no defined mean or variance.\n",

    "3. **Multinomial Distribution:** Describes the probability of observing counts among multiple categories.\n",

    "4. **Hypergeometric Distribution:** Models the probability of drawing a specific number of successes from a finite population without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Student's t-Distribution:** Widely used for hypothesis testing when the sample size is small and the population variance is unknown.\n",

    "1. **Fixed Number of Trials (n):** The number of trials or experiments is fixed in advance.\n",

    "   - **Binomial Distribution:** Each trial in the Binomial distribution is binary, resulting in either success or failure.\n",
